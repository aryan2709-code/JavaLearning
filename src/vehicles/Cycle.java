package vehicles;

// Important Information : In a .java file, we can have only one public class and the file name must exactly match with the
// name of that public class (Cycle in this case)
// We can define other classes in the same file , but they cannot be public, by default they have package-private visibility
// (accessible only within the same package) (vehicles package in this case)
// This rule exists because the Java compiler and the JVM need a 1 to 1 mapping between the public classes and file names for
// easy loading
// Package private classes help allow grouping helper classes with the main class without exposing them outside the package
