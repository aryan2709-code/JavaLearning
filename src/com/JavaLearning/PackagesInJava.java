package com.JavaLearning;
// A package in Java is a namespace (like a folder) that groups related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages.
// It helps organize code, enable reusability, and avoid naming conflicts.
//
// Steps to run a compiled Java file:
// 1. Navigate to the classpath root (the folder where the package structure begins, e.g., src).
// 2. Run the class using its fully qualified package name (e.g., java com.JavaLearning.Test).
//
// Note: The classpath is the starting location from which the JVM looks for package directories.
